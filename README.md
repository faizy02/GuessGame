- humanGuess - You would need to guess the number and computer will tell you if its higher or lower or correct
- computerGuess - Computer will guess the number, you would need to give feedback if its higher, lower or correct
- computerVsHumanAuto - Same as above but it will iterate automatically and we would see how many turns computer took to guess the number
